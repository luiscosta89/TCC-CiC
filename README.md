# An Immersive Visualization Study on Molecules Manipulation
In this work an immersive environment was developed in Unity 3D using C# to visualize molecules. The user may use the mouse
and keyboard or use VR equipmment such as the Razer Hydra controller and the Oculus Rift to manipulate the structures. A
detailed study was conducted with users to confirm that the immersive approach is better in several points when compared to non-
immersive approaches.

The study was published at the SVR 2017: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8114434/
